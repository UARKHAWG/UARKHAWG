### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**UARKHAWG/UARKHAWG** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working Software Engineering and reproducible research.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science at Bloomtech!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the outdoors, and state parks
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love traveling, hiking with my wife, kids, and dogs.
